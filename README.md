This is the model which would be used in the Project EcoFriend (App Name not Finalized), used to classify the type of plastic based on the plastic code printed on the bottle itself or the packaging. The model is created by the help of fast_ai vision learner and the data set is collected from various sources (kaggle and roboflow).

Just run the main.py file to create and export the model and import.py to run the model at a later time.

The directory of dataset would need to be changed.

For directly downloading the model go to the link given below:
