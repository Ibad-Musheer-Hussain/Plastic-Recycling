This is the model which would be used in the Project EcoFriend (App Name not Finalized), used to classify the type of plastic based on the plastic code printed on the bottle itself or the packaging. The model is created by the help of fast_ai vision learner and the data set is collected from various sources (kaggle and roboflow). Due to space constraints , I could not upload the dataset as it is greater than 700MB consisting of 4500+ images

No images from search engines were used in training this model

Just run the main.py file to create and export the model and import.py to run the model at a later time.

The directory of dataset would need to be changed.
